# Metrics & Measurement

## What are metrics?

Metrics are the measurement of different aspects of your product. These might include things like how many people complete a task, or how much revenue you’re making. Success metrics, also called Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), are the key metrics that define how we know we win.

> If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it – Peter Drucker

What you measure is what you end up optimizing for. Get a handle on your metrics early, and you’ll lay the foundations for authentic growth to follow.

### Vanity vs. Actionable Metrics

Vanity metrics are those that feel good, and might be great for some other business need, but don’t help us measure product performance. They’re easily manipulated, and they don’t bear a direct correlation with numbers that speak to business success.

On the other hand, actionable metrics are real data we can use to make decisions. They link directly to business success and speak to customer or audience behavior. They are usually very close to revenue and costs.

For each vanity metric, there’s a corresponding actionable metric that really tells you something important about what’s happening in your business. A classic example is *trial users* vs. *converting users*.

Track metrics that help you optimize your business for success and aren’t a meaningless distraction.

### Proxy Metrics

Common metrics sometimes share one common problem: they are lagging indicators. By the time these metrics have been tracked, it’s too late to correct the customer experience. If there’s a lot of latency between the time a customer provides feedback and it reaches product management or marketing, there’s a potential to overcorrect and waste a lot of time and energy.

Proxy metrics are powerful for four reasons:

1. They are easy to measure
2. They are correlated to (and ideally predictive of) the business’ goals
3. They are concrete and create a unifying vision for the team
4. They enable businesses to iterate faster by reducing latency

Proxy metrics are powerful because they enable businesses to use an upstream-metric to predict a downstream outcome, which reduces latency and accelerates experimentation cycle times. Faster experiments means discovering the right growth strategies sooner, and that’s a critical competitive advantage for every startup.

### The only metric that matters

How many people are really using your product? 

You need a metric that specifically answers this. Don't overcomplicate it. 

Whatever it is, it should be a signal that they are using their product in the way you expected and that they use it enough so that you believe they will come back to use it more and more.

Only then, you can really track your growth on a day-to-day, week-over-week, month-over-month basis.
