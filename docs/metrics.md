# Product Metrics and KPI

## What are metrics?
Metrics are the measurement of different aspects of your product. These might include things within your product, like how many people complete a task, or things affected by your product, like how much revenue you’re making. Success metrics, sometimes called key performance indicators (KPIs), are the key metrics that define how we keep score, like how many goals you scored in a soccer game.  [1]

### Vanity vs. Actionable Metrics
Vanity metrics are those that sound useful, and might be great for some other business need, but don’t help us measure product performance. Actionable metrics are real data we can use to make decisions. [1]

## HEART
> Google’s HEART Framework helps measure the quality of user experience.

The idea is a simple one; to deliver a series of user-centred metrics that allow you to measure the user experience on a large scale. These metrics can then be used for decision making in the product development process. [2]

### The Heart Metrics [2]
There are five metrics used in the HEART framework:

**Happiness:** How do users feel about your product? Happiness is typically measured by user satisfaction surveys, app ratings and reviews, and net promoter score.

**Engagement:** How often are people coming back to use the product? Engagement can be measured by number of visits per user per week, session length, or a key action, like the number of photos uploaded or songs listened to per user per day.

**Adoption:** How many people complete the onboarding process and become regular users? Adoption is measured by number of new users over a period of time or percentage of customers using a new feature.

**Retention:** What percentage of users are returning to the product? Retention is measured by churn.

**Task success:** Can users achieve their goal or task quickly and easily? Task success is measured by factors like efficiency (how long it takes users to complete the task) effectiveness (percent of tasks completed), and error rate.

### How to Use the HEART Framework [2]
#### Step 1: Set Goals
Setting goals up front is a great way to get every member of your team on the same page. Is it more important to attract new users, or increase engagement for existing users? What tasks do you want new users to complete? Remember that goals for a particular product or feature update may be different than the goals you have for your overall app.
It’s important to narrow down your list of goals to no more than 3.

#### Step 2: Define Signals
Every goal has related user actions. Mapping your goals to those actions can let you know whether you’re on track. What behaviors or attitudes would indicate your goal has been met or failed?

#### Step 3: Choose Metrics
Finally, distill signals into trackable metrics that you can monitor in a real-time dashboard.

The HEART framework is a useful framework because it’s simple and easy to understand. That makes communicating the reasons for selecting it easy across teams. While the framework may be designed for large projects; there’s nothing to stop it being implemented on smaller projects either – it’s just that the methods used for data collection are likely to vary.
