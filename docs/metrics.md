# Metrics & Measurement

## What are metrics?
Metrics are the measurement of different aspects of your product. These might include things within your product, like how many people complete a task, or things affected by your product, like how much revenue you’re making. Success metrics, sometimes called key performance indicators (KPIs), are the key metrics that define how we keep score, like how many goals you scored in a soccer game.  [1]

What you measure is what you end up optimizing for. Get a handle on your metrics early, and you’ll lay the foundations for authentic growth to follow.

### Vanity vs. Actionable Metrics

Vanity metrics are those that sound useful, and might be great for some other business need, but don’t help us measure product performance. 

Actionable metrics are real data we can use to make decisions. [1]

### Proxy Metrics [6]

Proxy metrics are powerful because they enable businesses to use an upstream-metric (i.e., number of friends added in your account) to predict a downstream outcome (i.e., becoming a long-term user), which reduces latency and accelerates experimentation cycle times. Great companies employ proxy metrics all the time. 

1. They are easy to measure; 
2. They are correlated to (and ideally predictive of) the business’ goals; 
3. They are concrete and create a unifying vision for the team; and 
4. They enable businesses to iterate faster by reducing latency.

### Understanding user activity

It’s important to assess what “activity” means for your product. Simply logging in is often not a good signal of engagement. Is the product or feature you’re building something you expect people to use every day? Is it every week?

A more meaningful approach is to break your users into segments and look at activity based on segments. 

Time is another important measure of engagement to consider. This might be time spent in your app or some measure like session duration or session length. The premise is that the more time users spend in your product, the more engaged they are.

### The only metric that matters [7]

How many people are really using your product? 

You need a metric that specifically answers this. Whatever it is, it should be a signal that they are using their product in the way you expected and that they use it enough so that you believe they will come back to use it more and more.

Only then, you can really track your growth on a day-to-day, week-over-week, month-over-month basis.
