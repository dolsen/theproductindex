# Competitive and Market Analysis

## Sizing the market
Understanding market size, and understanding your ability to penetrate that market, is all-important: If your market is too small you can’t make money, no matter how innovative the product or how competitive your pricing. Top down and bottom up analyses are two basic ways to evaluate that market. [1]

### Bottom-up approach: Based on current trends (Conservative)

A**bottom up**analysis is calculated by estimating potential sales in order to determine a total sales figure. A bottom up analysis evaluates where products can be sold, the sales of comparable products, and the slice of current sales you can carve out. While it takes a lot more effort, the result is usually much more accurate. [1]

**Steps:**
1. Ask yourself where people currently buy / solve / pay for a similar solution
2. Look for the sales volume for existing solutions. You may think that there’s nothing similar around, but in reality there’s probably things at least slightly similar.
3. Make a conservative assumption and calculate the percentage that you could get from the sales they in a specific timeframe.

**Pros**
* This is a more accurate approach because it looks at patterns that exist in sales today rather than the total market
* This is the best way to do it as a Product Manager

**Cons**
* It takes a little more effort and takes a bit longer.

### Top-down approach: Based on total market size (Optimistic)

A**top down**analysis is calculated by determining the total market, then estimating your share of that market. [1]


**Steps:**
1. Calculate the current Total Addresable Market (TAM), i.e. "I will sell a widget everyone can use at $1 and there are 300,000 people in my area")
2. Make an assumption of the percentage you can get of that TAM, i.e. "I could manage to get 5% of that market".

**Cons**:
* You need to make assumptions on how much market penetration you will have inside that market.
* It’s not the most respected way of estimating the potential market.

## Competitors

The most important thing is to capture all the players in the field. Use any tool to record every competitor that you find, known and unknwon. As a product manager in a company, you should already know who your biggest competitors are.

### Finding competitors

Sometimes, there are competitors that might not be that obvious. In order to find them, use any of these techniques to find them on Google:

1. Search exactly how the user would complain about her problem
2. Search on specific sites where people talk about their problems: Reddit, Quora, Yahoo Answers
3. Search exact phrases of your one-line pitch


### Types of competitors

- Direct -> Note: Try to be competitive to these
  - Same target customer group.
  - They solve the same problem and have similar solution and same price.
  - Users will need to decide you or they.
- Indirect -> Note: Not loosing too many customers
  - Solve the same problem but in a different way
  - Different customer group, maybe they include your solution and more
- Potential -> Note: Make sure they can’t do it easily
  - Same target group or similar
  - They aren’t solving the same problem
- Substitute -> Note: Be at least better than these
  - Same target customer group
  - They solve the problem in other way
  
### Understanding competitors

- The product core -> The product team competitors, How good they are? Engineer quality
- Know the size of they user based -> More bigger, more press, more feedback, more chances to win a niche
- Design -> Can they make a pretty product?
- Brand -> Perception of users have in the brand, more strong more hard to catch up. What is the gap between your brand and other one. 
- Speed -> How quickly they can build and ship?
