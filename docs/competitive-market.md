# Competitive and Market Analysis

## Market research - Sizing the market
Understanding market size, and understanding your ability to penetrate that market, is all-important: If your market is too small you can’t make money, no matter how innovative the product or how competitive your pricing. Top down and bottom up analyses are two basic ways to evaluate that market. [1]

A**top down**analysis is calculated by determining the total market, then estimating your share of that market. A typical top down analysis might go something like this: “Hmm… I will sell a widget everyone can use, and since there are 300,000 people in my area, even if I only manage to land 5 percent of that market I’ll make 15,000 sales.” [1]

A**bottom up**analysis is calculated by estimating potential sales in order to determine a total sales figure. A bottom up analysis evaluates where products can be sold, the sales of comparable products, and the slice of current sales you can carve out. While it takes a lot more effort, the result is usually much more accurate. [1]

## 4 types of competitors
- Direct -> Note: Try to be competitive to these
  - Same target customer group.
  - They solve the same problem and have similar solution and same price.
  - Users will need to decide you or they.
- Indirect -> Note: Not loosing too many customers
  - Solve the same problem but in a different way
  - Different customer group, maybe they include your solution and more
- Potential -> Note: Make sure they can’t do it easily
  - Same target group or similar
  - They aren’t solving the same problem
- Substitute -> Note: Be at least better than these
  - Same target customer group
  - They solve the problem in other way
  
## Criteria for understanding competitors
- The product core -> The product team competitors, How good they are? Engineer quality
- Know the size of they user based -> More bigger, more press, more feedback, more chances to win a niche
- Design -> Can they make a pretty product?
- Brand -> Perception of users have in the brand, more strong more hard to catch up. What is the gap between your brand and other one. 
- Speed -> How quickly they can build and ship?
