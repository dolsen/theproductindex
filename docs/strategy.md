# Product Strategy & Vision

One of the first things a great product manager should do before even thinking about a product is to understand the company that makes it. Every company is a little bit different, and they have different priorities, values, strengths, and weaknesses. Knowing these details about a company—understanding the full context of its current situation—is the starting point to find and evaluate product opportunities and make strategic product decisions.
    
Analyzing a company breaks down into three main categories: What product are we building? How do we know if our product’s good? What else has been, is being, and will be built? [4]

## Business Strategy vs. Product Strategy
**Business Strategy** is about identifying your business objectives and deciding where to invest to best archive those objectives.
**Product Strategy** speaks  to how you hope to deliver on the business strategy. 

Think of it this way. The business strategy and business portfolio planning provides a budget and a set of business metrics. The product organization then lives within that budget to pursue as aggressively as possible the best ways to hit those business metrics.[1]

Product Strategy is a system of achievable goals and visions that work together to align the team around desirable outcomes for both the business and your customers.[2]

A great product strategy tells the full story of why, what and how: It explains why your product matters, what you aim to accomplish and how you will do it. That’s it.

### 1. Why your product matters
  - Understand the problems before trying to solve them.
  - Address challenges worth solving.
  - Do your analysis well.

### 2. What you aim to accomplish
  - Focus on doing one thing really well.
  - Create an inspiring vision everyone remembers
  - Park hypothetical battles in the future.
  - Set a goal for the next big win.

### 3. How you will do it
  - Set product principles for rapid decision-making.
  - Detail the problem scope.
  - Set key metrics.
  - Articulate the results you aim for.
  - Clear the path for an autonomous team.
  - Pay your debt and run wisely. [3]
