What is Product Management?
Product managers are like the conductor in an orchestra. The conductor never makes a sound but is responsible for making the orchestra as a whole sound awesome to deliver a great performance to the audience. [1]

Great conductors understand and engage with everyone in the orchestra, using the right vocabulary with each section, diplomatically moving everyone together toward the shared goal of a great performance. [1]

This means that you think about the big picture, break it down into small pieces, and then build those small pieces first. After building the small pieces, you combine them to get the big picture. Learning to code will give you consistent practice thinking this way. [1]

Product Management is a perfect tool for helping teams in the day-to-day to direct technology development towards archiving business goals by focusing on customer needs. [2]

## Types of Product Managers
### According to the market
#### Internal PM
Generally advocates to the creation of internal tools for the company.
#### B2B
Most to the time your users won’t be your customer. Sales and Marketing will influence goals for your product.
#### B2C
More challenge, for millions of users, much pressure, uncertainly, extensive user testing.

### According to the PM background
#### Technical product manager
This refers to a PM who has a strong technical background, and who works on a technical product. For example, this person might work on a software API where the end customer is a software developer. Technical PMs won’t be writing the code or performing technical tasks, but they need to understand the details of what goes into those tasks.
    
#### Strategic product manager
This role is the complement to a technical PM, and it’s someone who has a strong business-oriented background.

#### Product marketing manager
A PMM is very similar to a PM, but a PM tends to be more internally focused—getting the product built—while a PMM is externally focused—working with customers to understand their needs and to communicate the product’s value.

## What is a product?
## Product Intuition
Product intuition is a skill, it is the observation of human behavior, trained by data, and applied to software.
In order to learn, you need quick feedback when you’re wrong. Feedback comes faster by understanding your customer and testing your assumptions than by launching a product no one wanted and blaming it on the marketing team.  [2]
