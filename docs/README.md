## What is a Product Manager?

Product managers are responsibles for the ultimate success of the product. They are like the conductor in an orchestra: the conductor never makes a sound but is responsible for making the orchestra as a whole sound awesome to deliver a great performance to the audience.

Although they are not managers of anybody, product managers need to lead the team without authority. They act as communicators that put all the pieces together by getting feedback from everyone else. 

> To discover a product that is valuable, usable and feasible - Marty Cagan

Product management can be defined as the intersection between business, technology and user experience.

#### Business
Product managers should be obsessed with optimising a product to achieve the business goals while maximising return on investment. After all, product management is a business function above all.

#### Technology
Product managers need to understand the technology stack and the level of effort involved to make the right decisions. Beyond defining *what* to build, they need to know *how*.

#### User Experience
Product Managers are the voice of the user inside the business, which means they need to be out there testing the product, talking to users and getting feedback first hand.

A good product manager must be experienced in at least one, passionate about all three, and conversant with practitioners in all.

### What they do

As a product manager you start with setting the vision for the product, which requires you to research your market, your customer and the problem they have that you’re trying to solve. You need to learn everything you can and use your creativity to come up with vision for the product.

Then, you need to turn yourself into an evangelist and spread the word in the company. The success of your product, relies on every team member – from sales to engineering – understanding the vision.

After that, you work on your product strategy to reach out that vision and creating a roadmap. This will allow you and your team to be one step at a time closer to that vision. As you and your team work on building the product, you will be defining and iterating the product, solving problems as they pop up and closely managing scope so product can get out on time.

Once the product is out there, you need to look at how customers are using the product, going out and talking to them about the product.

And then you do it all over again.

## Product Manager vs. Project Manager

Project managers are responsible for accomplishing the *project*, not a goal. A project usually has a timeline and a budget as a constraint. As a product manager, you have to have the skill of project manager in order to manage the execution of the different product releases. However, product managers are responsible for the success of the product, which is defined by key metrics.

## Product Manager vs. Product Marketing Manager

Product managers are responsible for defining the product to be built, and validating that product with real customers and users. Product Marketing Managers are responsible for telling the world about that product, including positioning, messaging and pricing, managing the product launch, providing tools for the sales channel to market and sell the product, and for leading key programs such as online marketing and influencer marketing programs.

## Types of Product Managers

Based on the relationship and type of *stakeholders*, which are the people that have input on what you are building, there are different types of product managers: 

#### Internal Product Manager

It's usually one of the best way to start within the company your are working for already. Generally advocates to the creation of internal tools for the company since is less risky. 

The number of users is small, but it's a great opportunity to learn a lot about technology and do a lot of project management.

### Business to business Product Manager

A good introduction role. Most of the time your users won’t be your customers and sales and marketing will influence goals for your product. You will be also dealing with tight deadlines and priorities based on revenue.

The number of users is small, but it's a good opportunity to be creative.

### Business to consumer Product Manager

The most challenging role since there's a good amount of uncertainty and pressure. The company can lose money so the risk is higher.

The number of users is often in the order of millions so you will be learning a lot, especially, doing extensive user testing.
