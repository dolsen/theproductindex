## Types of Product Managers
### According to the market
- Internal PM -> Create internal tools for the company.
- B2B -> Sales, Marketing will dictate goals for your product.
- B2C -> More challenge, for millions of users, much pressure, uncertainly, extensive user testing.

### According to the PM background
- Technical product management
This refers to a PM who has a strong technical background, and who works on a technical product. For example, this person might work on a software API where the end customer is a software developer. Technical PMs won’t be writing the code or performing technical tasks, but they need to understand the details of what goes into those tasks.
    
- Strategic product management
This role is the complement to a technical PM, and it’s someone who has a strong business-oriented background.

- Product marketing manager
A PMM is very similar to a PM, but a PM tends to be more internally focused—getting the product built—while a PMM is externally focused—working with customers to understand their needs and to communicate the product’s value.

## What is a product?
- Can be a product or a part  of it (ex: Facebook wall)
- Most large companies split their product managers by feature so they can build an expertise on just that one aspect of the product..
