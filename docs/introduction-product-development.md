# Introduction to Product Development

Building products with a lean approach is more successful because you’re not risking everything on a potentially long, slow-to-create project. Instead, you risk a little bit to build something small, learn from it, and iterate.[1]

> A product isn’t a collection of features; it’s an experience from the first touchpoint to the very end.

## Product Development Processes
1. Conceive -> Collect user problems and brainstorm possible solutions.
2. Plan -> Market research, exploratory interview, roadmapping.
3. Develop -> User stories, specs, start the MVP.
4. Iterate -> We test the assumptions.
5. Launch -> Work with Marketing, Sales. Go To Market Strategy.
6. Steady state -> Connecting metrics, analyze user feedback.
7. Maintain or Kill -> Can we compete? How frequently users use it? How much money are we spending to maintain it
