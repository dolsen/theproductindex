# The Growth Handbook

If your business isn’t growing, nothing else matters. It’s the perennial problem that faces businesses at all stages of their development.

The key to understanding growth is two things:
1. **A fundamental understanding of your product and the reasons people use it**: Knowing your true product value allows you to design the experiments necessary so that you can properly isolate cause and effect.
2. **A simple framework for doing your work**: This simplicity allows everyone to understand it and see how decisions were made in a logical, transparent way.

## Acquisition [1]

Word of mouth is the most economical way to acquire new users, but over time, its returns are diminishing. This requires new thinking and new acquisition channels alike. 

However, because it’s continuing to become easier to switch from product to product and the increase of ad, content, and social noise has gone up, it’s not only harder to acquire a customer, it’s also harder to keep them.

Most new businesses use short-term sales tactics to get their first 10 customers. That’s great at the start but terrible for sustainable growth. Transition to more long-term plans as you grow. Make sure you understand how customer aquisition is going to play long-term.

### After product–market fit comes product–channel fit 

Once you figure out product market fit, it’s immediately time to figure out what Andrew Chen and Brian Balfour call product channel fit. You need to identify your marketing channels, particularly the one or two you can use to go from wherever you’re at to that next level. 

### Why content is so powerful

Content marketing works but it takes time. If you get content marketing working, then you are able to retarget people. You are able to build lookalike audiences on different channels. If you’re creating great content, it builds links, which brings your domain authority up.

### Your ideal customer profile should bend – but not break 

The more your company has honed its ideal customer profile, the better targeted your sales team can be. That allows you to be a lot more efficient from both a sales and marketing standpoint, because you’re investing dollars against a segment of customers that is more willing and likely to buy your products, and to find success with them too.

That said, if your sales team isn’t pushing a little bit, that’s a miss too. Your sales team talks to more prospective customers than any other team in your organization, and they will have the best pulse on where you might unexpectedly be resonating in the market.

## Activation [2]

Activation is the science of turning acquired users into active customers: people that pay for and value your solution.

Marketers should care as much about the onboarding and first use experience and getting customers from trial to paid as they do about driving customers to their website or to sign up for trials.

For your product to survive, you need to activate your new signups by getting them to take the actions that will enable them to see value in what you’re selling. The sooner, the better. Start by first looking at the steps your most successful customers take before becoming successful.

### Finding your product's magic moment

Think about what the magic moment is for your product, and get people to experience it as fast as possible. You can lift your retention easily if you can connect people with what makes them stick on your site.

### Understand retention first

If you can identify the early actions that separate the retained customers from the customers who leave, you’ll be able to define and track activation and what drives real customer value.

Once you know your key action and your frequency target, you have to track that target over time.

### Activating customer long-term

Activation varies from product to product. However, a common mistake companies often make is only focusing on activation for the first 14 days of a customer’s life cycle.

Customers can be activated in hundreds of ways. They might have used a few key features, but have whole areas of the product they haven’t even explored yet. Think about activation per feature basis too.


## Retention [3]

It doesn’t matter how many active customers your startup acquires if none of them stick around in the weeks and months after signup. If your retention is low then all of the ingenious growth hacks that you apply to your product are basically meaningless. 

Churn is usually seen as a factor limiting growth on a month to month basis, but the impact on customer lifetime value (LTV) on Saas businesse is significant: the whole idea of the SaaS business model assumes the lower revenue per customer per month is offset by a longer lifetime of that revenue.

### Reducing the time to "aha" moment

Focus on providing meaningful value in a way that requires as little work as possible for customers to get that first taste of value – lower the barriers. Customers who got to this point are more likely to stay, leading to much higher engagement and accelerating growth of the active customer base.

### The Saas quick ratio

It’s the MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) that’s gained every month divided by the MRR that’s lost.

Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) retention will make or break the growth of your SaaS business – there’s no point filling the bucket if it’s full of holes.

### Retention strategy

Your retention strategy has to be proactive. Don’t wait until customers are on the brink of churning to throw some last-ditch attempts at them. Most importante, you need to understand why someone might leave your product and choose the right tactics to stop it. 


## Monetization [4]

Monetization is really the process of marrying your business model to customer value.

Growth is a symbiotic relationship. Just as your customers should be experiencing the value of your product, you should be extracting equal value from them.

### Getting pricing wrong

To figure out the right pricing strategy, determining what the buyer cares about is crucial. Do they care about cost or value?

The first thing to know about pricing is that you’re going to get it wrong. Pricing is a moving target, and if your business is growing it’s likely you’ll miss that target more than a few times, whether that’s setting their price low to attract customers and never raising it, or keeping a feature free long after it’s clear people will pay. 

The second thing to know about pricing is that you need to keep iterating on it constantly.

### Making pricing disappear

Your monetization has to feel fair to your customers. When you’re telling a potential customer the story of your product and how great it is, you never want them to think, Do I like this pricing, or not? You want pricing to disappear as a consideration.
