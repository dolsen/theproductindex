#  Building the product - Project Management for PMs

## What is Lean Product Development?
Build a thing without use too much resources until I’m sure it will work.

### What is Agile?
- Apply Lean mindset to Product Development
- Iterative method to develop software

### Scram
- Sprint planning meeting
- Sprint -> 2 weeks time-box
- Standup meetings
- Retrospective meeting

### Kanban
- Don’t use sprints
- The team just work on tickets
- Just a certain time of tickets can be in progress

### Waterfall Development
- Develop all features at the same time
- More risky

## Epic
A well-written epic is a key to have a good understanding and material to refer in case of any doubts during development. It helps in avoiding a lot of conflicts and misunderstanding in the team. Since this is what you will refer when writing the user story and all the other team member when working on the user stories it’s extremely important to collaborate and put some details in your Epic. As a product manager/owner while creating an epic include the following four things as the very basic structure. [1]

**Format of document epic**
  - Introduction
    - Summary of what features you are building and why.
    - What metrics are you trying to improve.
    - Marketing plans.
    - Early wireframes.
  - Product requirements
    - What is required for the specific features you want to build
  - Design requirements
    - The PM and designers works here thogeter
    - Sketch, prototypes
  - Engineer requirements
    - This sections is filled by engineers after discuss this with them

## User stories and acceptance criteria
### User stories
User stories are a way to describe a thing we’re going to build that delivers some type of functionality to the end user.
        “As an X, I want to do Y, so that I can Z”
Example: “As a user, I want to send pictures in a direct message to my friends, so that I can share my favorite photos with them”

### Acceptance criteria
Acceptance criteria are a set of conditions that software must satisfy in order to be considered complete.
Provides a list of specific requirements for the feature so you can test it later.

Example: “Given I am a user and I click the “Add picture” button in the direct message, I am presented with a popup window to choose the file I can upload, submit it with the upload button and see a preview of the uploaded image.

## Estimations and velocity
Sprint planning -> Story points -> Velocity
Average sprint velocity


## Roadmaps
Near-term, mid-term, long-term

## Prioritization
  - Buck -> Remove risky assumptions -> Attack first the riskiest assumptions
  - The buck method -> Business benefits, user benefits and cost
  - The Moscow method -> Must, could, should, would
