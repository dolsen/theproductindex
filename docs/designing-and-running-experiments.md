# Testing and Optimization

> To learn is to grow

The quickest way to stunt your company’s growth is resting on your laurels. So, what growth experiment will you run next?

## Timing

For young companies, small optimization projects just don’t make sense.

When you’re pre-scale the time, money and headspace spent trying to tweak systems that have to prove their worth is better spent elsewhere. Similarly don’t stress yourself if you read an A/B test that guarantees a 5% lift in conversions. It never delivers, copying someone else’s test results is like wearing someone else’s glasses. They weren’t meant for you.

## Opportunities  

As for specific opportunities, try at least one acquisition opportunity and one retention opportunity to start out. If a growth opportunity is not paying off anywhere near expectations, fail fast and try some other ones. 

Creating a growth mindset and applying a set of growth best practices is the way to systematically shifting your odds in favor. 

Consistent 1% improvements over time will yield larger and larger absolute increases in performance. Growth is the judicious, iterative improvement of all of the parts of your business that need to be improved, while maintaining a holistic sense of how all the parts fit together.

## Avoid snacking

Snacking is the "attractive" low-effort, low-impact work. It feels rewarding and can solve a short term problem, but if you never eat anything of substance it can kill you. By continually picking up the low-hanging fruit, the branches will stop growing, so this work dries up quickly as your product and team matures.

The wasted time compounds a lot quicker than the insignificant results. Do this enough times and you’ll grow a low impact team that doesn’t achieve anything.

## You are not your customer

It doesn't matter how much you look like the customer, you have way too much knowledge about this problem to assume that the way you do it is the way other people will do it. You can’t learn if you’re not putting your product in front of users and watching how they do it. 

Sure, an experiment can tell you what’s going on, but it’s not going to tell you why. You really need to do qualitative research.

# Designing and Running Experiments

Experiments can provide valuable insights for your product. However, many companies run experiments for the sake of running experiments without gaining any real insights which propel the product forward or achieve any interesting, insightful results. [4]

In order to learn from your experiments, you need to spend time upfront creating experiments that will deliver conclusive results at the end. [4]

Experiments should be run as genuine pieces of scientific, investigative work to try and find insights into problems and answers to interesting questions which help you to achieve your goals. [4]

Armed with results from a genuinely insightful experiment, you can inform your roadmap, your team and your stakeholders and reassess your goals with the insights you’ve gained. [4]

## Conceptualizing the Solution
In order to build a great product, you first have to conceptualize it. As a PM you have different tools like wire-framing, mockups and prototypes to do it.

## Assumptions
An assumption is something we believe is generally true with absolutely no evidence. It’s something we take for granted. Certain things in your product development process are not ok to be a part of your assumptions without trying to invalidate them first. [5]

Every innovation is based on a set of assumptions. Many of them will be right and many of them will be wrong. [5]

Obviously, some of these assumptions are more likely to be wrong and break your business model. Since the essence of an MVP approach to startups is to save as much time as possible, you should test the riskiest ones first. If they prove to be wrong you still have time to go back to the drawing board and pivot or move to another project. While tackling what’s riskiest is a simple enough concept to grasp, ironically it is quite hard to put into practice. [5]

### The format of an assumption
In order for my idea to be successful the following must be true…
I assume that:
  - My customer as x,y,z problem


## Hypotheses
A hypothesis it’s a statement of what you believe that is true.

Writing a hypothesis helps us gain a clear understanding of the problem we’re observing so that we can create a set of experiments, and test potential solutions. [6]

Creating a Hypothesis, we should investigate in this order:
  * Who is our target group?
  * Why does X do this and not that?
  * How can person X be motivated to take action Y?
  * How can we encourage potential users to sign up for our service?

### The Scientific Method [7]

Step 1: Make an observation
Step 2: Ask a question
Step 3: Form a hypothesis (or testable explanation)
Step 4: Make a prediction based on the hypothesis
Step 5: Test the prediction
Step 6: Iterate (use the results to make new predictions or hypotheses)

During this process we will generate measurable data to confirm or deny your hypothesis.


### Types
**Simple** (you can add the problem to it)
We believe ____(subject/target)____ will ____(predicted action)____ because ____(reason)__.

**Better**
If we ____(action)____, we believe ____(subject/target)____ will ____(predicted action outcome)____ because ____(reason)____.

**The PM way**
We believe ____(subject)____ has a ____(problem)_____ because ____(reason)____. If we ____(action)____, this ____(metric)____ metric will improve.

### How to define a good hypothesis
**Simple and Unambiguous**
“If 250 Los Angeles teachers were asked to treat minority students with more respect, then at least 50 teachers would call their students using ‘Mr./Ms.’ and their last name instead of their first name.”

**Measurable**
“Our customers donate to charitable causes twice per year.”

**Describes a Relationship**
“Students at Dalton High School that study less than four hours a week get a C or lower in at least one class per year.”

**Cause and Effect**
“**If** we feed ice cream to people, **then** the average **#** of drownings per day will increase.”

**Achievable**
“If an astronaut in a stable orbit around a black hole extends one foot past the event horizon of a black hole, then they will be pulled in entirely.”

**Falsifiable**
“There is an invisible, intangible tea cup floating between the Earth and Mars.”

##  MVP
An MVP is a product with a basic set of features that are enough to capture the attention of early adopter user and make your position on the market. [3]

The goal of the MVP is to quickly get feedback from customers and improve the product without having to invest a lot of time or money that could potentially go to waste. From the customer’s interaction with the MVP, the product can then go through cycles of improvement that result in a full-featured product that customers will love. [2]

> The MVP should allow the team to collect the maximum amount of user data and feedback with the least effort. [2]

Scope down your solution so that you’re only testing the hypothesis you mean to test. Constrain your solution to just satisfy the needs or solve the problems of your customer, or you’ll muddy the waters.
