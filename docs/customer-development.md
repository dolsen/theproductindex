## What is customer development?
Customer development is the practice of establishing a continuous and iterative communication line with your customer, so that you can come up with ideas, hypothesis, try them out, get feedback and adapt your product accordingly. [1]

Customer Development is a four-step framework developed by serial entrepreneur and business school Professor Steve Blank for discovering and validating the right market for your idea, building the right product features that solve customers’ needs, testing the correct model and tactics for acquiring and converting customers, and deploying the right organization and resources to scale the business. [2]

At a high level, Customer Development is about questioning your core business assumptions.  In other words, Customer Development teaches that rather than assume your beliefs about your business to be true, you should apply an engineering, or scientific method, to what is really not a scientific endeavor (building a business), in order to validate the ideas. [2]

The process resembles the scientific method:
  * Observing and describing a phenomenon.
  * Formulating a causal hypothesis to explain the phenomenon.
  * Using a hypothesis to predict the results of new observations.
  * Measuring prediction performance based on experimental tests.

Customer Development is all about understanding your customer — their problems and their needs. This understanding will allow you to create a solution that they care about. [3]

> Customer development lets you save money and time while deciding the market need. [3]

## Four stages of Customer Development

When building a business, the process is used to discover, test and validate the following your business assumptions:
  * A specific product solves a known problem for an identifiable group of users (Customer Discovery)
  * The market is scaleable and large enough that a viable business might be built (Customer Validation)
  * The business is scalable through a repeatable sales and marketing roadmap (Company Creation)
  * Company departments and operational processes are created to support scale (Company Building) [2]

## Customer Discovery
Customer discovery is applying scientific method to business, is the most lean and efficient method to get user needs. During this process we will generate measurable data to confirm or deny your hypothesis.

Customer Discovery phase is composed by the next four steps:
  - State problem hypothesis.
  - Test the problem hypothesis
  - Test solution
  - Verify you hypothesis or pivot

The final goal of customer discovery is figure out:
  - Who are your customers?
  - Is the problem you’re solving important to them?
  - Extra and important: Will customer pay for your solution?

Forming a problem hypothesis is the correct way to learn about user needs.

### What is a Problem Hypothesis
Problem Hypothesis is the starting point of customer development. Starting with a Problem Hypothesis you starts being concern about the user problems and not in product what is a common mistake.

To create a problem hypothesis you should define:
  - Who are your users.
  - What are their needs, goals, or desires.

**The Problem Hypothesis format**

As a [user type] I want [behavior] so that [outcome or benefit].

Once you have formulated the correct hypothesis you will create surveys and interviews to validate the user needs and goals.

## User research
Avoid guessing at what a user needs, nothing is more important than research, look for data to confirm you assumptions and talk to your customer is the key to the success of customer discovery.

We divide the research on two steps, the first one Secondary Research is the initial research, you can start to validate your assumptions with research that already exists, then Primary Research, when you directly talk with your customers to start to validate your hypothesis and look for opportunities.

To validate your assumptions you should be sure about:
  - You had identified a problem the customer wants solve.
  - Does you product solves the customers’ needs?
  - Is your business model viable?
  - Have you learned enough to begin selling it?

### Defining the target market
It’s important to get feedback from your target users about their problem and not for an unspecific  market. You should determines if someone would be a good candidate for user feedback, usually this process is called Screener.

We used to define our target audience based on demographics, The latest way to segment the target audience is about the attitude or the way they see the world, this segmentation is called Psychographics.

**Psychographics**

People are classified by their attitudes, aspirations and psychological data. Ex: People who believe in global warming.

### Secondary Research Technique
As a PM always start from here, using data that already exists
**Secondary Research**
  - Academic research.
  - Private research firms.
  - Consumer reports.
  - Expert interviews.
  
### Primary Research Technique
After the Secondary Research, you start to talk directly with you target user with two common methods:
  - Surveys
    - Measure attitudes.
    - Collecting quantitative feedback.
    - Understand the degree of user beliefs.
  - Interviews
    - Open end questions.
    - Allow the user speak freely.
    - Watch the user language.
    - Tailor the conversation.
    - Dive more deeply with questions.
    
## Surveys
Before you create a survey you should ask yourself what questions do you want answer with it and figure out whatever or not the survey is the right tool or not.

Surveys are good for:
  - Measure attitude, intent, or task success.
    - How the user feel about this?
    - How important is this for the user?
    - How successful is the user at complete this task?
  - Track changes over time.
    - Maybe over your product or specific features.
  - Quantify user problems.

Surveys should be short(less than 5 minutes) and for a specific purpose or insight.

## User Interviews
To truly understand the user needs and goals you need to talk to your customers, customer interview is the most flexible and accurate tool to do that.

- Don’t talk about your product -> Talk about what they want, what they need.
- Don’t talk about your opinion.
- Create a comfortable environment.
- Don’t force the conversation, guide it.

### Good questions, bad questions

1. Ask open-ended questions
2. Don’t ask binary questions
3. Don’t ask hypothetical questions
4. Don’t ask leading questions
5. Don’t ask questions that might make them lie
6. Extra, always say: Thats interesting, tell me more

### Four types of Interviews
1. Exploratory Interview
Open questions, look for pain points, are they up for pay for a solution?
2. Validation Interview
You have a theory and you want to test it out, approve or disapprove.
3. Satisfaction oriented interview
What users think about your product. What should we stop doing? What I can do better for you?
4. Efficiency Interview
Who uses your product? What they do with it? In what circumstances. How easy is to use feature X?
