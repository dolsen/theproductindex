# Mastering the problem space

> Because our goal is to explore the problem space as much as possible, it’s key to open up to divergent thinking and embrace new ideas. Based on our customers and their needs – what are the benefits of our product for them?

> As product managers it is our job to answer the question “how will our product be the best?” by focusing on the problem, always ensuring our work ties back to the problem space and the customer need, and avoiding solution pollution.

## The Product/Market Fit Pyramid [4]

The term Product/Market Fit was coined by Marc Andreesen back in 2007 and it’s been a key goal for any new product or startup ever since. But like any buzzword, it is often oversimplified and misunderstood.

This is a framework covering the universal conditions and patterns that have to hold true to achieve product/market fit. Each layer in the pyramid is a key hypothesis that you need to get right in order to build the next layer and ultimately achieve product/market fit.

It’s all too easy to get stuck in the solution space, after all we all love designing products and jumping in to building things. But our job as product managers is to focus on the problem space, explore it as much as possible, and make sure that what we build is actually solving a customer problem.


## Assesing Product Opportunities

The product manager must be able to quickly evaluate opportunities to decide which are promising and which are not; what looks appealing, which should be pursued, which are better left for others, and which ideas are not yet ready for productization.

### Defining the problem with POA

> Product Opportunity Assessment (POA) is an extremely important responsibility of the product manager. The purpose of a good product opportunity Assessmentt is to either:
 a) prevent the company from wasting time and money on poor opportunities by ultimately proving the idea should be shelved for now, or
 b) for those opportunities that are good ones, focus the team and understand what will be required to succeed and how to define that success.

### Ten fundamental questions 

1. Exactly what problem will this solve? (value proposition) 
2. For whom do we solve that problem? (target market) 
3. How big is the opportunity? (market size) 
4. How will we measure success? (metrics/revenue strategy) 
5. What alternatives are out there now? (competitive landscape) 
6. Why are we best suited to pursue this? (our differentiator) 
7. Why now? (market window) 
8. How will we get this product to market? (go-to-market strategy) 
9. What factors are critical to success? (solution requirements) 
10. Given the above, what’s the recommendation? (go or no-go)


## Value proposition

Your Value Proposition needs to answer two questions: 
1. Which customer needs will your product solve?
2. How will your product be better than competitors?


### The Kano Model

The Kano model allows to start mapping out possible solutions to customer problems against three axes: must-haves, performance benefits, and delighters. The key lesson is that these change over time – what starts as a delighter often quickly becomes a must-have – so this job is never done. [1]

In order to find product/market fit you shouldn’t try to compete on must-have features, just make sure you have them and do them well enough. Instead, spend time and effort on your product’s unique differentiators. [1]
