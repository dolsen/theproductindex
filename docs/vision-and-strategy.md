# Product Vision & Strategy 

One of the first things a great product manager should do before even thinking about a product is to understand the company that makes it. Every company is a little bit different, and they have different priorities, values, strengths, and weaknesses. 

Knowing these details, is the starting point to find and evaluate product opportunities and make strategic product decisions.

Product managers have lots of choices to make everyday so developing awareness of where they have leverage is critical to their long term impact:

**Vision and Strategy are foundational**: They provide the direction, the inspiration, and enable a group of people to execute as a team.

**Scope and Backlog are optimizations**: They accelerate progress towards a known destination.

Both are important, but going faster in the wrong direction is far worse than going slower in the right one.

Your team is full of smart engineers and designers who know better than you how to build things, so if you start focusing on the implementation details, not only are you exerting less managerial leverage, you’re also diminishing their leverage.

## Product Vision

Product vision is used to describe the end state of your team’s efforts. A good vision influences the everyday micro-decisions being made by a team. It should also be the basis of alignment between a product team and their stakeholders.

The product vision has to fit into the bounds of the company’s vision.

## Product Strategy

Product strategy describes the chosen approach towards achieving the vision. A strategy is not a roadmap. Roadmaps should be an output of strategy and answers the following questions: 

1. What has been, is being, and will be built, and why
2. Who we’re going to target and why
3. How we’re going to grow and why
4. How do we know if our product’s good , and why

A great product strategy tells the full story of why, what and how: It explains why your product matters, what you aim to accomplish and how you will do it.

**Why your product matters**
- Have a deep understanding of the problem before trying to solve it
- Be ruthless to address challenges worth solving
- Build your own toolbox with frameworks and models to do a great analysis

**What you aim to accomplish**
- Focus on doing one thing really well and learn to say no
- Create an inspiring vision to push everyone to think big and stay on the same page
- Reduce the cognitive load of your team by keeping them focused on the present
- Stretch your team towards an inspiring long-term goal

**How you will do it**
- Set product principles for rapid decision-making
- Detail the problem scope to bring clarity to your team
- Set metrics to hold yourself and your team accountable for actual impact
- Articulate the results you aim for
- Clear the path for an autonomous team and ensure smooth operation
- Set the right balance and pay your product debt

## Business Strategy vs. Product Strategy

Business Strategy is about identifying your business objectives and deciding where to invest to best archive those objectives. On the other hand, product strategy speaks to how you hope to deliver on the business strategy.

The business strategy provides a budget and a set of business metrics. The product organization then lives within that budget to pursue as aggressively as possible the best ways to hit those business metrics.
