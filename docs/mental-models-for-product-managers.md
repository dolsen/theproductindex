# Metal Models for Product Managers

In simple words, a mental model is a representation of how something works for someone as per their context. Just as thoughts flow freely, mental models take different forms in different contexts, depending upon the person’s understanding of the world.

A popular analogy to mental models is that they are like tools in a toolbox. So, depending upon your need, you pick the tool to achieve the result efficiently and with speed.

Let's take a look to a few that are relevant to the key aspects of product management — strategic decision making and understanding your team.

## Eisenhower Decision Matrix (Urgent-Important)

The idea behind this model is — you should be able to identify what urgency means exactly. By helping determine which task belongs in which quadrant, the matrix helps to prioritize, which is key to succeed as a product manager.

Using the decision matrix below, you will separate your actions based on four possibilities:

1. Urgent and important -> tasks you will do immediately.
2. Important, but not urgent -> tasks you will schedule to do later.
3. Urgent, but not important -> tasks you will delegate to someone else.
4. Neither urgent nor important -> tasks that you will eliminate.

One of the most common mistakes of new product managers is get caught on the "urgent" but not important.


## The Inversion Principle

This mental model helps you visualize what not to do in order to be successful. Instead of focusing on what you want to achieve, invert it and think how you won't make it. The process of using the Inversion Principle is very simple: [4]

1. *Define the problem*: What is the problem you are trying to solve?
2. *Invert it*: What would you have to do to guarantee the failure of your objective?
3. *Consider the solutions*: What would you have to do to avoid the failure that you identified in the previous step?

Imagine the most important goal or project you are working on right now. Now fast forward six months and assume the project or goal has failed. [3]

Tell the story of how it happened. What went wrong? What mistakes did you make? How did it fail? In other words, think of your main goal and ask yourself, “What could cause this to go horribly wrong? [3]


## Emotional Intelligence

The ability to recognize, express and control our emotions is essential. The same goes for understanding, interpreting and responding to other people’s emotions. [1]

> For leaders, the first task in management has nothing to do with leading others; step one poses the challenge of knowing and managing oneself. - Daniel Goleman [1]

* **Self-awareness** — to understand and take control of your moods and emotions. When you are aware of your impulses and moods, you are better equipped to take control of them and its effect on your peers.
* **Self-management** — to manage your own work without external help. It helps you see if your motivation is intrinsic or driven by external factors like bonus or appreciation.
* **Empathy** — to understand what the other person is going through and treating them with compassion and care.
* **Social Skills** — to help understand how you interact with your team and your ability to build relationships.


## Perverse incentives

This model break the myths around monetized incentives to improve performance.

A perverse incentive is an incentive that has an unintended and undesirable result or "cobra effect" which is contrary to the interests of the incentive makers.

## Peter Principle

> In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence - Lawrence Peter

This model helps to detect early signs of stagnation, lack of motivation and fall in performance. [1]

In our modern hierarchical organizations, we are promoted to a better title (and salary) when we kick ass in our current position. But, over the years, after climbing the corporate ladder through promotions we get to a position where we turn out to be useless. [5]
